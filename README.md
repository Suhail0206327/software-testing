## What is software testing?

Software testing is the process in which verification and validatiing of the software is done.
### Verification:
Here verification is asking that "are we building the software right?". Yes, its more about checking if it is build correctly. Here we will be checking our code functionality and quality standards. We will be inspecting whether our software requirments are reached.
### Validation:
Validation will be more focussed on the other side where how the users are able to use the software. Here we are asking "are we building right software?". Here we will be checking that is the customer able to perform the task as required. We will be validating all the functionalities and behaviours and make sure everythings is working as expected.

## History of software testing

The software development started after the second world war. A computer scientist called Tim Kilburn wrote the first piece of code for a software that generate mathematical calculation in 1948 from the University of Manchester. Debugging was the main way of testing sofware and it remained till 1980s, after that people started to come up with some testing plans to test the apps quality in the real world. In 1990s the testing changed to quality assurance by iterating through all the cylces in software production using test cases. 

Do you know the story behind the first bug. In 1940s a bug was entered to the computer room of US military system and trapped in the vaccuum tube. The US military team was the one where grace hopper was warking with. So yeah that might be the reason behind the name bug.
