## What is software testing?

Software testing is the process in which verification and validatiing of the software is done.
### Verification:
Here verification is asking that "are we building the software right?". Yes, its more about checking if it is build correctly. Here we will be checking our code functionality and quality standards. We will be inspecting whether our software requirments are reached.
### Validation:
Validation will be more focussed on the other side where how the users are able to use the software. Here we are asking "are we building right software?". Here we will be checking that is the customer able to perform the task as required. We will be validating all the functionalities and behaviours and make sure everythings is working as expected.

## History of software testing

The software development started after the second world war. A computer scientist called Tim Kilburn wrote the first piece of code for a software that generate mathematical calculation in 1948 from the University of Manchester. Debugging was the main way of testing sofware and it remained till 1980s, after that people started to come up with some testing plans to test the apps quality in the real world. In 1990s the testing changed to quality assurance by iterating through all the cylces in software production using test cases. 

Do you know the story behind the first bug. In 1940s a bug was entered to the computer room of US military system and trapped in the vaccuum tube. The US military team was the one where grace hopper was warking with. So yeah that might be the reason behind the name bug.

## Why do we need to do software testing?

The main reason for doing the software testing is that to make sure our final product is ready to use without major problems. We can see even the operating system softwares get some bugs and the team fix those using a software update. Yeah so we can do minor fixes but it should not be a big one that may effect the functionality of the final products. For example imagine that we build a software for a rocket and the rocket is launched and moved out of earths gravity and later we found a problem in the software that effect its functionality. So all the efforts, energy , expenses everything is in awry because of not testing the functionality of the software. So it will be better to test our software propertly and double checking everything is okay. It will help to save a lot of money and make our efforts count.

## Types of software testing

### 1. Integration testing:

First of all integration means bringing the small particles together to make a joined new one. On the other hand differenciation means breaking the bigger particels into small ones. So here in integration testing we will be joining different parts and testing the whole. For example in a ecommerce website there will be individual compenents like authentication , product cataloge, shopping cart, payments and we combine all of these together and then test if it works as expected when integrated.
