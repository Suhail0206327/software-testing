## What is software testing?

Software testing is the process in which verification and validatiing of the software is done.
### Verification:
Here verification is asking that "are we building the software right?". Yes, its more about checking if it is build correctly. Here we will be checking our code functionality and quality standards. We will be inspecting whether our software requirments are reached.
### Validation:
Validation will be more focussed on the other side where how the users are able to use the software. Here we are asking "are we building right software?". Here we will be checking that is the customer able to perform the task as required. We will be validating all the functionalities and behaviours and make sure everythings is working as expected.
